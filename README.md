# Music Generation
****
Description
A RNN model is learning on Billie Eilish Music Dataset.
Using convolution layer for the spectrogramme information for dimension reduction.
Than passed to a LSTM recurrent unit. 

For prediction stage the output of each recurrent unit is passed to the following (in time) recurrent unit.

**The structure of the model is the following:**
Here i will upload an image


**The assesment of model performance:**
..1. Accuracy
..2. F1-Score
